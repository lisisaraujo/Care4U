## Technical Structure

#### Project Structure
The project follows the MVVM and Repository architecture pattern. 

#### Data Storage
Data is stored using Firebase. User authentication details, posts, and user profiles are managed through Firebase Firestore. This choice allows for real-time data synchronization and easy scalability.

#### API Calls
The app utilizes the Google Places API to enhance the search functionality for services offered by users.


## Outlook
In the future, I plan to enhance GoGig with additional features:

- [ ] Planned Feature: Advanced Filtering Options for Posts

- [ ] Push Notifications for Updates
